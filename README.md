# Attrition-and-Workforce-Overview

Objective
The main goal of this project is to understand how employees are joining, staying, and leaving the company.
 It helps HR teams see:
how attrition (employee exits) is changing over time, which departments or locations have higher attrition, how long employees are staying (tenure), and whether hiring and exits are balanced.
Overall, this dashboard helps the company make data-based HR decisions and improve employee retention.
