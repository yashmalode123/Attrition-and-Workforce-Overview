# Attrition-and-Workforce-Overview

Objective
The main goal of this project is to understand how employees are joining, staying, and leaving the company.
 It helps HR teams see:
how attrition (employee exits) is changing over time, which departments or locations have higher attrition, how long employees are staying (tenure), and whether hiring and exits are balanced.
Overall, this dashboard helps the company make data-based HR decisions and improve employee retention.


**Data and Tools Used**

**Data Source:** HR employee dataset (with joining date, exit date, department, etc.)
**SQL (BigQuery):** Used to clean the data, calculate KPIs like headcount, attrition, and tenure.
**Looker Studio:** Used to create the dashboard and make it interactive.

**Business Impact**
1) HR can now easily track attrition trends without manually calculating every month.
2) It’s easier to identify departments or locations with high turnover and take action.
3) Helps in manpower planning — knowing where to hire or where to focus on retention.
4) Saves a lot of time compared to manual reports and gives a clear visual story.


**Conclusion**
This project helped me understand how HR data can be used for real business insights.
It connects multiple metrics like headcount, tenure, and attrition to show a full picture of workforce health.
The dashboard makes HR reporting faster, automated, and easier to understand.
